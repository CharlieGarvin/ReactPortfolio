# ReactPortfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio I created with my newly learned React skills. It feautires some simple animations and basic styling. As I get better with React I intend to update this portfolio to show off more of my skills with the language. Please feel free to look around my portfolio and look at the other projects I have linked to it. All of my contact information is linked with the icons in the footer and on the homepage.
