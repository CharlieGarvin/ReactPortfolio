        skills: "This was the final project of my bootcamp. We were tasked with making a site that would take real world data and use it somehow. We created a site that can help come up with unique band names using the Spotify API as reference to see if the name is taken. It required using React, CSS, JS, JWT, Node.js, MongoDB. I did lots of work on the frontend to help get it responsive and polished."

We made a typing game that would then take your scores and save them to your account and allow you to ccompete with other users. The languages used were HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL, and more.
